/// A shard represents an interception with an edge over a range of y-values (generally a single pixel in height)
///
/// This type of intercept is called a shard as it represents a wedge where at one extreme the shape does not overlap
/// the image at all, and at other other it overlaps it 100%. The `LinearSourceOver` PixelProgramPlan can be used to
/// create an anti-aliasing effect where the shape is faded in across a scanline. 
///
/// When entering a shape the start position has an opacity of 0% with the end position being where the shape is 100% 
/// opaque, and when leaving a shape the reverse is true.
///
/// For very thin shapes, 'entry' and 'exit' shards may overlap.
///
/// Shards are an appoximation: they assume that the shape is locally flat, and it is possible to construct concave
/// shapes that can confuse the algorithm. Additionally, this won't add pixels for very long thin spikes.
