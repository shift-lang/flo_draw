//! `flo_draw` is currently based on glutin, but uses its own event structure: this is to make it so that
//! it's possible for future versions to replace glutin easily if that ever proves to be necessary, and
//! to support easy porting of code using `flo_draw` to other windowing systems. This also isolates software
//! implemented using `flo_draw` from changes to glutin.
